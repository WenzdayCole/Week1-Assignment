# Week1-Assignment
Making a website for a producer. (maybe)
REFLECTION:
I'm not entirely happy with the end product. Yes, I have a header and a picture but, I could not figure out flex box to allign everything the way I wanted. I had to just uses absolute positioning. 

I added some music but in my head I imagined alot more songs on there in a column in the middle of the screen. I spent quite some time trying to figure out how to do it with flex-box andd eventually gave up.
